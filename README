Facebook Test Account Generator
------------------------------------
from http://www.incaranted.net

A simple tool to help you manage your Facebook users.

If you don't want to have to keep logging into the Facebook dev areas
to manage your users or you would like some example code on how to 
create and view test users, then hopefully this will come in handy.

If you want more info on Facebook test users, check out
the doco here: https://developers.facebook.com/docs/test_users/


USAGE
------------------------------------

1. Download the code and upload it to somewhere on your server
    * Somewhere obscure or password protected so people don't mess with it!
	
2. If you haven't already, download the Facebook PHP SDK and put it in 
   the same directory - https://github.com/facebook/php-sdk
   If you have it already, you can alter the require_once at the start of the 
   php file to point to it.
   
3. Add your App ID & Secret to the relevent lines in the php file.

3. Profit!
